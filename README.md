# Java-Code-Quiz
To create a quiz to test JavaScript fundamentals

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a quiz to test the user on JavaScript fundamentals. To create the quiz, I used HTML, CSS and Javacript. Specifically, I learnt how to: 

- Create an array with the questions, options and the correct answer for the quiz
- Create a function which displays the questions and checks answers 
- Use a timer interval for the quiz and created a function where the remaining time would become the score of the user 
- Use local Storage to store the user's score and initials once the quiz is completed 
- Display the user's score and intials on a high score page and provide an option to clear the scores from the page
